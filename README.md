# Heart Disease Classifier using Logistic Regression

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

This project implements a Logistic Regression model in Jupyter Notebook to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in a given sample. The model is trained using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains various medical attributes for each sample, along with a binary target variable indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.

The Logistic Regression algorithm is a powerful tool for binary classification tasks like this one. By training the model on the provided dataset, we aim to create an accurate classifier capable of early detection and diagnosis of heart disease, contributing to better patient outcomes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be obtained from Kaggle at the following link: [Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/your-kaggle-username/heart-disease-dataset). You will need to sign in to Kaggle and accept the terms of usage to download the dataset. Once downloaded, place the dataset file (`heart_disease.csv`) in the same directory as this Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation

To run this Jupyter Notebook and interact with the code, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can install them using Anaconda or pip.

1. **Install Anaconda:** Follow the instructions on the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to download and install Anaconda, which includes both Python and Jupyter Notebook.

2. **Install required libraries:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries:
